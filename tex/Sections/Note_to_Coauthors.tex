Please work with me to use colors to track the text status:
\begin{description}
	{\color{blue}\item[Blue text] Text that JAF has reviewed. It is near final. Proofread, but do not change unless you discuss with JAF.}
	{\color{black}\item[Black text] Text cut and pasted from our other written documents that needs to be edited to fit this paper.}
	{\color{green}\item[Green text] Marks missing text. Provide a draft if you know how. Discuss with me if you are unsure.}
	{\color{magenta}\item[Magenta text] Text added by Ashim that is almost ready to be reviewed by Professor Farrell.}
	
\end{description}
Do not under any circumstances cut and past from the internet or other papers.

Do insert references as appropriate for text that is yours. If you got an idea from some reference, it should be cited.

If you insert or edit text, mark it in a new color and edit your color into the list above, so that we know who to talk to about which text.

Do not add new packages without discussing with me.  

All matrices and vectors should be in boldface using the definitions in settings.tex.
